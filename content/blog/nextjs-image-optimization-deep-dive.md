# Next.js Image Optimization Deep Dive (2025)

Images drive conversionsâ€”and bandwidth bills. Next.js gives you powerful tools to deliver crisp visuals fast.

## Core Concepts

- Automatic resizing and modern formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Smart caching and domain whitelisting
- Responsive `sizes` to match layout containers

## Practical Setup

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/assets/images/dev2.jpg"
      alt="Developer at work"
      width={1600}
      height={900}
      priority
      sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 1200px"
      className="rounded-xl shadow-lg"
    />
  );
}
```

## Performance Tips

1. Provide exact width/height for static images
2. Use `placeholder="blur"` where helpful
3. Avoid layout shift by respecting aspect ratios
4. Compress assets at source; don't rely only on runtime

## Common Pitfalls

- Missing `sizes` on responsive layouts
- Rendering huge images in small containers
- Overusing `priority`; reserve for LCP media

## Conclusion

Measure with Lighthouse and Web Vitals, then iterate. Small wins on images often yield the biggest UX improvements.
