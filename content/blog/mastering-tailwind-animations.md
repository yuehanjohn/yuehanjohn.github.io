# Mastering Tailwind CSS Animations and Micro-Interactions

Micro-interactions bring interfaces to life. With Tailwind CSS you can craft tasteful motion without introducing heavy animation libraries.

## The Philosophy: Motion With Purpose

- Direct attention, never distract
- Prefer small distances and short durations
- Ease-in for entrances, ease-out for exits
- Respect reduced-motion preferences

## Utility-First Motion

Tailwind ships with helpful animation utilities and is easy to extend.

```css
/* tailwind.config.js (excerpt) */
extend: {
  keyframes: {
    float: {
      '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(0)' },
      '50%': { transform: 'translateY(-4px)' },
    },
  },
  animation: {
    float: 'float 3s ease-in-out infinite',
  },
}
```

```html
<button class="relative inline-flex items-center gap-2 hover:scale-[1.02] transition-transform">
  <span class="i-lucide-sparkles animate-float" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  Save
</button>
```

## Patterns That Work

1. Hover lift on cards: `transition-transform hover:-translate-y-1`
2. Subtle shadow pop: `hover:shadow-xl` with `duration-200`
3. Focus ring fade: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary/40 focus:outline-none`

## Respecting Reduced Motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .animate-float { animation: none !important; }
}
```

## Takeaways

Start small, animate intent, and prefer utility classes. Your UI will feel faster and more polishedâ€”without extra bloat.
