# Getting Started with Next.js and React

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications by providing a powerful framework that combines the best of server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers several compelling advantages:

- **Performance**: Built-in optimizations including automatic code splitting and image optimization
- **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side rendering ensures better search engine visibility
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, TypeScript support, and excellent debugging tools
- **Flexibility**: Choose between static generation, server-side rendering, or client-side rendering per page

## Key Features

### 1. File-based Routing

Next.js uses a file-based routing system that makes navigation intuitive:

```jsx
// pages/about.js automatically creates /about route
export default function About() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>;
}
```

### 2. API Routes

Build full-stack applications with API routes:

```jsx
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Hello World' });
}
```

### 3. Image Optimization

The Next.js Image component provides automatic optimization:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero Image"
      width={800}
      height={600}
      priority
    />
  );
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript** for better developer experience and type safety
2. **Optimize images** with the Next.js Image component
3. **Implement proper SEO** with the Head component
4. **Use CSS Modules** or styled-components for styling
5. **Configure ESLint** for code quality
