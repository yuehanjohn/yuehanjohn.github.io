# Design Systems that Scale

A durable design system turns chaos into clarity.

![System thinking](/assets/graphics/kaewtaartsupply.jpg)

## Layers

1. Foundations (color, type, spacing)
2. Tokens (semantic names)
3. Primitives (Button, Input, Card)
4. Patterns (Forms, Navigation)

## Guardrails

- Token-only CSS
- Visual regression tests
- Accessibility baked-in

Design systems are productsâ€”iterate and adopt gradually.
